Github Repo Search
==================

I made this app to test out AngularJS and see how it is writing applications in it. The repo search has the following features:

* pulls all repos associated with a username
* orders them by number of open issues
* filters out via fuzzy-type search

[Demo](http://antjan.us/labs/github-repo-search) is available. It depends on JS libraries grabbed from a CDN so be sure you're connected to the internet if you're running this locally!
